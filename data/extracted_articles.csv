ROCKLAND COUNTY, NY — A 4-week-old kitten fostered out by the RG Cares Animal Shelter to a local school with an animal care program died of rabies, and now the school and the shelter are working with the Rockland County Health Department to give the rabies vaccine to those who came in contact with it. Cat rescue agency Four Legs Good is running the RG Cares Animal Shelter under a short-term contract with Rockland Green, the county's waste and animal-care authority, which had its charter amended in 2022 to allow it to also handle animal control. The Summit School at Nyack offers day and residential education and support programs as a special education secondary school. Its program Pets for Purpose gives the children opportunities to care for animals, take on responsibilities, and spend time outdoors. Find out what's happening in New Cityfor free with the latest updates from Patch. The kitten was one of three too young to be vaccinated being fostered at the school. Rabies vaccines are typically given to cats at 12 to 16 weeks. ""Little kittens are often fostered out of a shelter to give them a better chance of survival,"" Dawn Bernstein of Four Legs Good told Patch. Baby kittens need to be fed around the clock. Bernstein herself spent hours bottle-feeding the kitten, which was medically cleared before she was placed in foster care. The kitten was never diagnosed with animal bites; the veterinarian's discharge paperwork indicated abscesses. Find out what's happening in New Cityfor free with the latest updates from Patch. ""You could see she had some injuries, but there was no sign of anything serious,"" Bernstein said. ""She was drinking from the bottle, she was happy and playful."" Then the kitten became ill and died at a local animal hospital. The other two are back at RG Cares, in isolation. At the school in Upper Nyack, roughly 90 students and staff members were undergoing the series of rabies vaccines, CBS News New York reported. Patch requested but had not received a statement from the school before this article was published. It will be updated. Bernstein has also begun the series of shots. She said county health officials had been efficient and cooperative. ""They are exceptional."" Rabies is an infectious disease that affects the central nervous system in mammals. People usually get it from the bite of a rabid animal, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Some types of contact, such as petting a rabid animal or contact with the blood, urine or feces of a rabid animal, are not associated with risk for infection. It is possible, but rare, for people to get rabies from non-bite exposures, which can include scratches, abrasions, or open wounds that are exposed to saliva or other potentially infectious material from a rabid animal. ""I don’t want anyone to be afraid to rescue and save an animal,"" Bernstein told Patch. While rabies is rare in people in the United States, with only 1 to 3 cases reported annually, about 60,000 Americans who've been exposed get the post-exposure series of 2-4 shots, the CDC said. It's a myth that the treatment requires 20 or more painful shots to the stomach with a ""monstrously long needle,"" the National Library of Medicine points out. In a statement, the New York state Department of Health said, in part, ""Human rabies does not have a treatment and is almost always fatal, which is why vaccine and human rabies immune globulin is in the best interest of anyone exposed."" Rabies testing requires that the animal be euthanized. To check for rabies, the test must include tissue from at least two locations in the brain, the CDC said. RG Cares is currently at the old, overcrowded, decrepit animal shelter formerly known as the Hi-Tor Animal Care Shelter, at 65 Firemen's Memorial Drive in Pomona. Cares stands for Center for Animal Rescue and Educational Services. Hi-Tor was the only animal care and control shelter in Rockland, taking in more than 2,500 animals each year. The County of Rockland had traditionally provided some funding to and made county facilities available to Hi-Tor for animal control and care. The shelter was run by a small staff augmented by volunteers and supported through fundraising and contracts with municipalities for animal control. But it suffered for years from overcrowding and underfunding, in a facility basically unchanged since 1972. It also suffered from lack of resources and infighting. A new larger facility was to be built using county, state and private funds (a ceremonial groundbreaking event was held in October 2021); but the plan was scrapped when town officials expressed concerns about Hi-Tor's operations and competence. The board of Rockland Green, which had been founded in 1994 to handle waste recovery, disposal and prevention for the county, saw an opportunity to expand and received approval from the Rockland County Legislature and New York State Legislature. The Rockland County government's involvement in local animal control came to an end. The boards of Hi-Tor and Rockland Green signed a contract under which Rockland Green was to increase the taxes it levies to cover $1.4 million for the shelter and $225,000 for a lease on a planned new shelter location in Haverstraw, the Rockland Business Journal reported. The current shelter manager is Michael Sanducci, who had managed Hi Tor until he was ousted in 2018 for complaining about lack of essentials including support and money from the shelter's board — which offered justifications that infuriated the previous board's president. Sanducci was brought back by RG Cares after Rockland Green fired Hi-Tor's executive director, board members, and staff in September. Meanwhile, the operation limps on at the old facility in Pomona.

code354,https://lc.cx/QKBnFY,Vigilance urged following confirmation of single case of Bluetongue in Kent,"Vigilance urged following confirmation of single case of Bluetongue in Kent Date published: The Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) for Northern Ireland (NI) has urged farmers to be vigilant following confirmation of a single case of Bluetongue Virus (BTV-3) in a cow in Kent. Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a notifiable exotic disease and is transmitted by midge bites. It affects cows, goats, sheep and camelids such as llamas. The midges are most active between the months of April and November. There are currently no vaccines which are effective against this serotype of the virus (BTV-3). Bluetongue does not affect people or food safety. Meat and milk from infected animals are safe to eat and drink. NI’s Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Robert Huey said: “While Bluetongue doesn’t affect people or food, it can have a significant impact on livestock. It can cause sickness, reduce reproductive performance, reduce milk yield and, in the most severe cases, it can cause death in adult animals. “Farmers must be vigilant in sourcing livestock from responsible sources, spotting clinical signs early and reporting the disease as soon as possible. For more information on clinical signs please see the DAERA website (Bluetongue | Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (daera-ni.gov.uk)) “We are taking all actions necessary to assure ourselves that the disease hasn’t and won’t spread to Northern Ireland, including carrying out post-import surveillance.” Defra has taken measures to ensure that the risk of spread of the disease is reduced, with movement restrictions at the affected premises. The cow has been culled to reduce the risk of onward disease transmission. A 10km temporary control zone around the affected farm is also in place, which will restrict movements of susceptible animals except under license. As a result of this confirmed case of BTV-3, moves of all ruminants and their germinal products from Great Britain (GB) to NI will be temporarily suspended as they are now not eligible for certification. In addition to our general surveillance for BTV, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) is also taking immediate action to trace all cattle and sheep movements into NI from GB since 1 October. These livestock will require isolation and post import testing by the Department. Local Divisional Veterinary Offices will be in contact with affected livestock owners to arrange testing which will assist in ensuring that NI remains BTV free. It is important that farmers report early any suspicions of disease to their Private Veterinary Practitioner, to the DAERA Helpline promptly on 0300 200 7840 or by contacting their local DAERA Direct Veterinary Office. More information about bluetongue is here: Bluetongue | Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (daera-ni.gov.uk) Notes to editors: - Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a notifiable exotic disease that infects ruminant animals (such as sheep, cattle, goats and deer) and camelids (such as llama and alpaca). - It is caused by a virus that is spread by biting midges. Midges are most active between April and November. Virus transmission can occur when temperatures are higher than 12c. - The virus can also be transmitted via infected germinal products (semen, ova and embryos). - There are 26 known serotypes of BTV, several of which are circulating in Europe. BTV3, BTV4 and BTV8 pose the greatest risk due to the proximity of nearby outbreaks in France, Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany. England is at risk of these serotypes of BTV arriving via midges carried across the English Channel and North Sea on the wind. - Follow DAERA on Twitter and Facebook. - All media queries should be directed to the DAERA Press Office: or telephone: 028 9052 4619. - The Executive Information Service operates an out of hours service for media enquiries only between 1800hrs and 0800hrs Monday to Friday and at weekends and public holidays.

Under the plan, health authorities will conduct clinical tests on the entire herd at farms reporting lumpy skin disease infections and selectively cull only those that test positive, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs. Earlier, authorities implemented a policy of destroying all cattle at farms that reported an outbreak. Areas with high risks of LSD infections, however, will still be subject to an all-out culling policy, the ministry said. On Saturday, the ministry said it has completed inoculating some 4.05 million cattle in the country to protect them against LSD after launching the vaccination campaign following its first-ever outbreak in late October. Authorities, meanwhile, plan to remain vigilant for the time being as it will take three weeks for the cattle to develop antibodies. The country has confirmed 91 cases nationwide so far but did not report any additional cases the previous day.

code360,https://northernag.net/usda-to-allow-importation-of-fresh-beef-from-paraguay/,USDA to Allow Importation of Fresh Beef from Paraguay,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is publishing a final rule that will allow the importation of fresh beef from Paraguay. APHIS conducted a risk analysis and concluded that fresh beef can be imported safely from Paraguay under certain conditions. These conditions include verifying that: - Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has not been diagnosed in the exporting region in the past 12 months, - The meat comes from premises where FMD has not been present during the lifetime of any of the animals, and - The animals were inspected before and after death, among others. USDA says these measures are consistent with the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, which governs, among other things, trade in animal products. In the final rule, fresh (chilled or frozen) deboned beef will be eligible for import, and APHIS expect beef imports to fewer than 6500 metric tons annually, in part due to a quota Paraguay faces on beef exports to the United States. The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA) strongly opposed the decision by USDA. NCBA has repeatedly raised concerns with USDA over Paraguay’s history of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and the information used to justify Paraguay’s access to the U.S. market, which NCBA says is outdated. NCBA is concerned that USDA’s failure to use information from recent site visits in the risk assessment may pose great risk to the safety of the U.S. cattle herd. “USDA based their decision to allow beef imports from Paraguay on a deeply flawed risk assessment that uses old data from site visits that were conducted more than nine years ago. Paraguay has a history of FMD outbreaks, and it is unclear if their inspection system can provide an equivalent level of safety for animal health to prevent a possible FMD outbreak on U.S. soil,” said NCBA Executive Director of Government Affairs Kent Bacus. “Paraguay heavily relies on private sector funding for most of its FMD mitigation measures, and USDA did not consider the risk associated with Paraguay’s economic downturn over the last several years. “Gaining beef access to the U.S. market has been the top priority for Paraguay in multiple rounds of trade discussions. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that a foreign country’s beef access to the United States was a pre-determined outcome and used as a bargaining tool for other U.S. interests. The dismissal of legitimate concerns from U.S. cattle producers is unacceptable and USDA should halt this unscientific, unsafe rulemaking. While winning friends and allies in South America may be part of the long-term interests of U.S. diplomacy, it should not be done on the backs of U.S. cattle producers or by putting at risk the health and livelihood of the safest and most efficient cattle and beef production system in the world.” NCBA filed comments earlier this year calling on USDA to continue blocking fresh beef imports from Paraguay due to Paraguay’s history of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and the outdated information from site visits in 2008 and 2014 that were used to justify Paraguay’s access. NCBA also raised concerns about Paraguay’s ability to fund and administer FMD safeguards and called into question the security of the borders they share with other countries including Brazil. NCBA urged USDA to continue the ban on Paraguayan beef imports until a thorough review can be conducted and U.S. cattle producers are assured Paraguay is able to provide an equivalent level of safety for U.S. consumers and livestock. ### USDA/NCBA",en,2023-11-12,Paraguay,fièvre aphteus,,bovins,médias,3617,585,

Entre le début de l'année 2023 et le 23 octobre 2023, 1 190 cas suspects, dont 110 décès, ont été recensés dans 15 provinces. Plus de la moitié des décès ont été signalés dans les provinces de Kaboul et de Balkh. Au total, sur 1 052 cas suspects testés en laboratoire, 370 cas ont été confirmés positifs. Pakistan Une épidémie de FHCC est en cours dans la province pakistanaise du Baloutchistan (voir la nouvelle du 10 octobre 2023). Les informations sont très limitées. A la mi-octobre, 41 cas de FHCC dont 15 mortels auraient été pris en charge à Quetta, la capitale du Baloutchistan. Cette épidémie est maintenant à l’origine d’infections de professionnels de santé. Il semblerait que l'épidémie chez les professionnels de santé a fait suite à l'hospitalisation, le 22 octobre, d'un patient à l'hôpital provincial Sandeman de Quetta, qui a été testé positif à la FHCC trois jours plus tard. A la date du 9 novembre, 17 cas positifs ont été identifiés chez des professionnels de santé, et 3 décès sont survenus. Les malades ont été transférés à Karachi. Commentaires La FHCC est endémique au Baloutchistan et des cas confirmés ont été sporadiquement signalés dans une vingtaine de districts depuis 2000. Les données cliniques enregistrées montrent que les cas sont principalement signalés dans les zones rurales et frontalières avec l'Afghanistan, où l'élevage est une source courante d'économie domestique. En avril 2023, uneimportante épidémie de FHCC en milieu hospitalier avait été signalé au sein d’un hôpital de Kandahar, en Afghanistan. Une semaine après l’hospitalisation d’un cas de FHCC, 48 cas supplémentaires ont été suspectés dans le même hôpital, et 14 de ces cas ont été confirmés par des tests de laboratoire comme étant des cas de FHCC. Parmi les cas confirmés figuraient 13 membres du personnel hospitalier et un patient hospitalisé.

La liste des communes concernées (qui figure dans le document à télécharger ci-après) est fixée au niveau national par le Ministère de l’Agriculture et de la Souveraineté Alimentaire. La MHE est une maladie à virus transmis exclusivement par des moucherons (Culicoïdes), qui affecte les ruminants sauvages et domestiques : les bovins, les cervidés et dans une bien moindre mesure les ovins et caprins. Les cas cliniques de la maladie se manifestent par l’hyperthermie (fièvre), des difficultés respiratoires, des œdèmes de la face et de l’encolure, de l’hypersalivation, des boiteries. Les ovins et caprins sont réceptifs au virus mais ne présentent pas de signes cliniques. Les symptômes sont similaires à ceux de la fièvre catarrhale ovins (FCO). Tout comme la FCO, la MHE n’est pas transmissible à l’homme. La maladie circule dans la péninsule ibérique et en Italie depuis début 2022. La MHE est, au niveau européen, soumise à obligation de surveillance et de déclaration, ainsi qu’à des restrictions de mouvement des animaux. Elle fait aussi l’objet d’une certification aux échanges avec les autres Etats membres. Les zones régulées concernent les communes se situant dans un périmètre de 150 km autour d’un foyer. Des mesures de surveillance et de prévention vis-à vis de la MHE, chez les bovins, ovins, caprins ou cervidés des élevages, sont mises en place. L’objectif est d’éviter la diffusion de la maladie à partir des foyers identifiés et d’assurer une surveillance sanitaire de la zone. Le ministère de l’Agriculture et de la Souveraineté Alimentaire (MASA) publie régulièrement la carte des zones régulées. Le principe est que les bovins, ovins, caprins ou cervidés d’élevages ne puissent pas sortir des zones régulées. Une liste de dérogations est toutefois établie pour des mouvements spécifiques d’animaux : envoi d’animaux à l’abattoir notamment. La désinsectisation en éliminant le vecteur permet d’éviter la propagation de la maladie. Des mesures complémentaires ont été prises pour permettre la sortie des animaux sensibles (bovins, ovins, caprins ou cervidés d’élevage) des zones régulées : tout animal amené à quitter la zone régulée liée aux foyers confirmés de cette maladie doit avoir fait l’objet d’un test de dépistage en laboratoire attestant l’absence de contamination, en complément de la désinsectisation.

Florent Selvini Ajaccio - Aiacciu Les bêtes insulaires sont victimes du stéréotype 8 de cette maladie, importé depuis le continent par des bovins, selon les professionnels de la filière ovine. Ces derniers réclament notamment la prise en charge de la vaccination ainsi qu'un plan de relance de l'activité auprès des services de l'État qui devraient apporter une réponse d'ici le début de semaine. Depuis le 23 septembre, des cheptels insulaires sont victimes du stéréotype 8 de la fièvre catarrhale, importé depuis le continent par des bovins, qui sont des porteurs sains, selon les professionnels de la filière ovine. ""Ce variant, très virulent, est en train de se propager. En Corse, on connaissait les stéréotypes 1 et 4 mais pas le 8"", indique Jean-Louis Paoli, président de l'interprofession laitière ovine et caprine de Corse (Iloc). Dans ces circonstances, une réunion s'est tenue ce mercredi 15 novembre, dans les locaux de la préfecture, notamment entre les acteurs de la filière et les représentants des deux chambres insulaires. Les agriculteurs corses réclament la prise en charge de la vaccination ainsi qu'un plan de relance de l'activité auprès des services de l'État. ""Nous avons engagé la responsabilité de l'État car les contrôles des bêtes n'ont pas été faits. Quatorze cheptels ont déjà été touchés en Corse et on recense 20 % de pertes, c'est par ailleurs très évolutif"", poursuit Jean-Louis Paoli. Dans cette logique, les agriculteurs insulaires sollicitent une prise en charge à ""100 % de la vaccination, plafonnée à 3 euros par bête"". Ils réclament aussi : ""L'indemnisation des cheptels touchés pour la partie animale mais aussi pour la perte de production, sur trois années. Nous souhaitons également travailler ensemble pour proposer un plan de sauvegarde de la filière ovine et caprine de Corse et enfin nous avons demandé l'accélération du paiement des aides. Nous avons fait une première demande à l'office du développement agricole et rural de Corse (Odarc) pour le versement d'une aide et une autre aux services de l'État"". Selon Jean-Louis Paoli, ces aides auraient déjà dû être versées. ""On nous a assuré qu'elles le seront le 10 décembre"".

""The ministry wishes to inform members of the public that the outbreak did not extend to Botswana,"" said Christopher Nyanga, a spokesperson of the Ministry of Health, in a statement. Nyanga said through the Botswana Public Health Institute (BPHI), Botswana has activated its surveillance mechanisms and strengthened its detection and early warning systems, to ensure that the disease does not spread to Botswana, adding that the health, agriculture authorities and other stakeholders have put in place all the necessary precautions and safeguards, to ensure their safety. Anthrax is a disease largely found in animals and predominantly spread to humans through eating infected animals. Nyanga said the ministry is optimistic that the possibility of spreading to Botswana and to humans is minimal. ""The public is, however, advised to remain vigilant and avoid touching or eating animals that are found dead,"" said Nyanga.

Movements of ruminant animals from Great Britain to the island of Ireland have been suspended. On November 10, a single case of bluetongue virus serotype 3 (BTV-3) was confirmed in a cow in Kent, in the south-east of England. The UK's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is taking measures to ensure that the risk of spread of the disease is reduced, with movement restrictions in place at the affected premises. As a result of this confirmed outbreak in England, all moves of ruminant animals and their germinal products (semen, embryos) from Great Britain to Ireland (including Northern Ireland) are temporarily suspended. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is undertaking tracing of all cattle and sheep movements from Great Britain into Ireland since October 1. Relevant RVOs will be in contact with livestock owners who have imported cattle or sheep from Great Britain since October 1 in order to arrange surveillance testing. Ireland is currently free of bluetongue virus, which is a viral disease of ruminants and camelids (camels, alpacas, llamas, etc.) that continues to be of widespread concern across mainland Europe. Bluetongue does not affect human health or food safety. However, if bluetongue virus entered Ireland it would have ""serious trade implications for live animals and germinal products"", the department here said. Bluetongue virus is spread by infected midges (culicoides species) which are present in Ireland and are generally most active between April and November. The disease could spread to Ireland through import of infected animals, infected foetuses or wind dispersal of infected midges from mainland Europe. The virus can also be transmitted via infected germinal products (semen, ova and embryos). There is currently no EU-approved vaccine against bluetongue serotype 3 and it is not yet known if vaccines against other bluetongue serotypes can provide protection. A number of different bluetongue serotypes are currently circulating in Europe: The department has issued advice on how to prevent bluetongue entering Ireland. Importers are advised to consider other ways to achieve desired genetic or breed changes (such as through artificial insemination) rather than importing bluetongue susceptible-animals from mainland Europe. If animals are imported, they should be imported when midges are less active (December to March). Other advice includes:",en,2023-11-16,Royaume-Uni,fièvre catarrhalo ovine,who,bovins,médias,2637,403,

code380,https://lc.cx/H6WPCS,Nouvelles Du Monde,"Politique-Spectacle : Eric Swalwell Fait le Pari de l’Anti-Trumpisme, la Nouvelle Scène de Conflit à Washington Dans un climat où l’opposition démocrate cherche sa voix, la confrontation directe devient une performance médiatique prisée, transformant les élus en protagonistes d’un drame national. Bienvenue dans l’arène politique de 2025, où les joutes verbales s’apparentent de plus en plus à des superproductions et où les carrières se construisent sur la force de la riposte. Dans ce théâtre permanent, le représentant démocrate Eric Swalwell semble prêt à jouer un rôle principal. Sa stratégie : capitaliser sur son historique de confrontation directe avec l’ancien président Donald Trump, une approche que de nombreux électeurs démocrates appellent de leurs vœux. Le “Modèle Californien” : Combattre le Feu par le Feu Cette posture n’est pas isolée. Elle s’inscrit dans une tendance plus large, particulièrement visible en Californie, menée par le gouverneur Gavin Newsom. Ce dernier a fait de l’opposition frontale à Donald Trump sa marque de fabrique. Oubliées, la diplomatie feutrée et les réponses institutionnelles. La nouvelle devise est de “combattre le feu par le feu”. Comme le rapporte Le Monde, Newsom a adopté une tactique de “surenchère, crier plus fort, en rajouter dans l’invective et la vantardise” lemonde.fr. Il n’hésite pas à se proclamer le « GOUVERNEUR PRÉFÉRÉ DE L’AMÉRIQUE » en lettres capitales sur les réseaux sociaux, utilisant l’ironie et le trolling comme armes politiques. Cette méthode, bien que critiquée, le positionne en “opposant numéro un à Trump”, selon une analyse du journal Le Devoir ledevoir.com. Une Réponse à la Quête d’Identité Démocrate Le succès de cette approche pugnace s’explique par un vide stratégique au sein du Parti démocrate. Face à un adversaire qui a redéfini les règles de la communication politique, la réponse traditionnelle semble souvent inaudible. Selon France24, le Parti démocrate “peine à organiser l’opposition” face à l’avalanche de décisions et de déclarations de l’administration Trump, créant une frustration palpable au sein de sa base électorale qui réclame une riposte plus musclée france24.com. Des figures comme Swalwell et Newsom répondent à cet appel en transformant chaque interaction en un épisode d’une série à suspense. Swalwell, Acteur d’un Récit Bien Rodé Représentant le 14e district de Californie depuis la refonte des circonscriptions de 2023, et siégeant au Congrès depuis 2013, Eric Swalwell n’est pas un novice fr.wikipedia.org. Il a méthodiquement construit son image de procureur anti-Trump, utilisant les plateformes médiatiques et les réseaux sociaux pour diffuser ses attaques. Ses interventions sont souvent courtes, percutantes et conçues pour devenir virales, comme en témoigne son activité sur X (anciennement Twitter). Donald Trump is not a victim. He’s a victimizer. Don’t feel sorry for him. He’s where he is because of his own conduct. Hold him accountable. — Eric Swalwell May 31, 2024 Ce positionnement n’est pas sans risque. Il expose à la critique de privilégier la forme sur le fond, le “clash” sur la législation. Mais il répond à une demande du public pour des figures politiques qui ne se contentent pas de dénoncer, mais qui combattent avec les mêmes armes médiatiques que leur adversaire. Quand la Politique Devient Divertissement En fin de compte, la stratégie d’Eric Swalwell et de Gavin Newsom illustre la fusion croissante de la politique et du divertissement. Le débat public se déplace des hémicycles vers les écrans, où l’attention se gagne par la dramaturgie et la performance. Ce phénomène soulève une question d’intérêt public : cette “politique-spectacle” est-elle une réponse nécessaire et efficace à un paysage médiatique saturé, ou contribue-t-elle à l’érosion du débat de fond ? Pour l’instant, le public semble avoir choisi son camp : le spectacle doit continuer. Et à Washington comme à Hollywood, les acteurs qui savent capter la lumière sont ceux qui restent à l’affiche. ✔ Structure organique + titres variés ✔ Faits vérifiés + statistiques ✔ Intégration des réseaux sociaux (le cas échéant) ✔ Qualité suffisante pour que Google l’indexe instantanément ✔ Article final prêt à être publié",en,2025-11-21,Afrique,,,,médias,4225,652,

code383,https://lc.cx/vksaMe,Menace émergente : virus de la rage provenant de ouistitis trouvé chez des chauves-souris brésiliennes -,"Une étude récente a révélé un lien surprenant entre les variantes du virus de la rage trouvées chez les chauves-souris et celles présentes chez les ouistitis à touffes blanches du nord-est du Brésil. Cette découverte est importante en raison du risque potentiel de transmission de la rage à l’homme, et est particulièrement préoccupante puisqu’un homme est décédé en mai après une morsure de ouistiti. Émergence dans la faune La rage, une maladie mortelle pour l’homme, est de plus en plus détectée chez diverses espèces sauvages, notamment les ouistitis que l’on trouve dans les forêts et les zones urbaines du Brésil. Les ouistitis, souvent capturés comme animaux de compagnie puis abandonnés, ont été impliqués dans des cas de rage humaine. Cette émergence constitue une préoccupation pressante de santé publique. Aperçus de l’étude L’étude a été menée par des chercheurs de la faculté de médecine de l’Université fédérale de São Paulo (EPM-UNIFESP) et soutenue par la FAPESP. Les résultats mettent en évidence la similitude entre les variantes de la rage chez les ouistitis et les chauves-souris. Des chauves-souris frugivores et insectivores, qui ne sont généralement pas associées à la rage, ont été trouvées porteuses du virus, ce qui indique une dynamique de transmission complexe. Les chauves-souris qui se nourrissent de sang sont les hôtes les plus probables. Des rencontres meurtrières « Sept ouistitis ont récemment été testés positifs à la rage. La rage est endémique au Ceará, où des personnes ont été attaquées par des ouistitis et sont mortes de la rage. Un de ces décès s’est produit en mai », a déclaré l’auteur principal de l’étude, Larissa Leão Ferrer de Sousa. En février, un ouvrier agricole de 36 ans près d’une ville appelée Cariús a été mordu par un ouistiti enragé. « Le ouistiti est tombé dans son jardin. Il était semi-paralysé, ce qui est un des symptômes de la rage. L’homme a essayé de l’aider, et il l’a mordu », a déclaré Sousa. « Les animaux atteints de la rage ne sont pas toujours agressifs et ne moussent pas nécessairement à la bouche, symptôme que la plupart des gens associent à la rage. Parfois, il n’y a aucun symptôme apparent. Avertissement public Sousa déconseille de toucher les animaux sauvages, y compris les chauves-souris, et suggère de contacter la surveillance locale de la santé animale pour les animaux sauvages morts. Des soins médicaux immédiats et une vaccination sont cruciaux après un contact avec un animal, car les symptômes de la rage signalent généralement une issue fatale. « La rage incube pendant 45 jours en moyenne, il est donc extrêmement important que toute personne infectée reçoive immédiatement une prophylaxie post-exposition (sérum et vaccin). Lorsque les symptômes apparaissent, il est généralement trop tard et le patient meurt », a déclaré Ricardo Durães-Carvalho, chercheur à l’EPM-UNIFESP et chercheur principal de l’étude. Séquençage génétique Les chercheurs ont séquencé l’ARN de 144 échantillons de tissus cérébraux de 15 espèces de chauves-souris. Ces échantillons, collectés dans le cadre d’un programme national de surveillance, ont révélé chez les chauves-souris des variantes du virus de la rage étroitement liées à celles des ouistitis. Ensuite, l’équipe a retracé l’histoire évolutive des virus découverts à l’aide d’outils assistés par ordinateur. Le premier ensemble de séquences était compatible avec les variantes du virus de la rage trouvées chez deux espèces de chauves-souris insectivores du sud-est du Brésil en 2010. Cependant, un autre groupe de variantes trouvées chez deux espèces de chauves-souris insectivores et une espèce frugivore étaient liées, sur le plan évolutif, au virus détecté chez les ouistitis du Nord-Est. Implications de l’étude « Nos résultats nous ont permis de déduire que les différentes variantes du virus de la rage qui étaient étroitement liées en termes d’évolution étaient originaires du même animal, révélant une dynamique de débordement complexe et une transmission virale multiple entre hôtes », a déclaré Durães-Carvalho. Si les chauves-souris et les ouistitis jouent un rôle clé dans la transmission de la rage, ils sont également cruciaux pour l’équilibre écologique et sont menacés par la perte d’habitat. Le respect et la protection de ces animaux dans leurs habitats naturels sont essentiels au maintien de la santé des écosystèmes. La découverte de variantes du virus de la rage chez les chauves-souris liées aux ouistitis au Brésil rappelle les relations complexes entre la faune sauvage, les humains et les maladies. La conservation de la faune et la vigilance de la santé publique sont d’une importance cruciale pour prévenir de futures épidémies. Ouistitis à touffes blanches Les ouistitis à touffes blanches, également connus sous le nom de ouistitis communs ou ouistitis à touffes blanches, sont des singes du Nouveau Monde originaires d’Amérique du Sud. Ils ont été trouvés à l’origine le long de la côte nord-est du Brésil, dans divers États, dont Piaui, Paraiba, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco, Alagoas et Bahia. En termes d’apparence, ces ouistitis sont assez petits, avec une longueur de corps d’environ 12 à 15 centimètres et une longueur de queue allant de 29,5 à 35 centimètres. Ils se distinguent par leurs touffes d’oreilles blanches et une flamme blanche sur leur front. Leur fourrure sur la tête est généralement brun foncé, tandis que leur fourrure sur le dos est de couleur brun grisâtre avec de légères rayures transversales. Le ouistiti à touffes blanches vit dans des familles élargies stables, ce qui témoigne de sa nature sociale. Un aspect intéressant de leur comportement réside dans leurs habitudes alimentaires. Ils se nourrissent principalement de gommes et de sucs d’arbres, utilisant leurs incisives inférieures pour créer des trous dans les arbres producteurs de gomme. Cette action induit un écoulement de gomme des arbres, qui constitue pour eux une source de nourriture importante. L’étude est publiée dans le Journal de virologie médicale.

NSW DPI animal biosecurity manager Elizabeth Braddon said anthrax is unpredictable as it can lie dormant in the soil for decades. “Farmers should contact their Local Land Services district vet to obtain advice specific for their properties,” Dr Braddon said. “Vaccination prevents anthrax from occurring and helps break the cycle of spore production. “If vaccination is continued over time, spores in the environment will die, reducing the risk of anthrax occurring in the future.” Anthrax is listed as prohibited matter under the NSW Biosecurity Act 2015 and is a notifiable disease in NSW. Anyone who suspects anthrax must report it immediately by calling the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline on 1800 675 888. LLS acting business partner, animal biosecurity & welfare Emily Stearman said anthrax disease is caused by the bacterium, Bacillus anthracis and affected stock often show few or no signs of ill health before they die. “Farmers can apply to use the vaccine through their LLS district veterinarian and once authorised, they can place an order for the vaccine with their local rural supplier or private veterinarian,” Dr Stearman said. “Farmers should suspect anthrax if animals die suddenly. “In many cases there may be no signs and the disease may begin with the sporadic deaths of single animals over a few days before building to dramatic losses in a very short time.” More information about preventing anthrax is available on the NSW DPI website or from LLS by calling 1300 795 299.",en,2025-12-11,,anthrax,who,,médias,1811,292,
code388,https://lc.cx/TzTdQG,CWD confirmed in Yellowstone National Park for first time,"Yellowstone National Park and the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD) announced yesterday that chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been confirmed for the first time in the park, which involves an adult mule deer found dead. In a National Park Service statement, officials said WGFD had in March captured the deer near Cody, roughly 50 miles to the east, and fitted it with a GPS collar as part of a population dynamics study. The collar indicated that the deer died in the middle of October. It was found on the Promontory, a land mass that separates the south and southeast arms of Yellowstone Lake. Increased monitoring and other steps Samples were positive for CWD on multiple tests that were conducted by the WFGD's Wildlife Health Laboratory. As a result, park officials are stepping up collaboration with the WGFD and other agencies to identify Yellowstone areas at increased risk for CWD, increasing monitoring of the park's deer and other cervids, and increasing the investigation of carcass identification and sampling. The park also said that, based on the detection, it is revising its 2021 CWD surveillance plan, which it expects to complete in 2024. CWD was first detected in mule deer in southeastern Wyoming in 1985 and was first found in elk in the state the following year, according to the WGFD. Over the past two decades the disease has spread westward, affecting most of the state, especially mule deer. CWD is a prion disease similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (""mad cow"" disease). The prion causes fatal neurologic disease in cervids. So far, no infections in humans have been found, but health officials urge people to avoid eating meat from infected animals and to take precautions when field-dressing or butchering animals.",en,2025-12-08,,chronic wasting disease,,cerfs,médias,1759,289,

Photo supplied. News Date: 18 November 2023 On Tuesday, 14 November, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development hosted a Stock Theft and Foot-and-Mouth Disease Awareness event at the Jack Botes Hall in Polokwane. MEC Thabo Mokone warned people that buying stolen livestock is a crime and that they can get arrested for it. “We are planning operations, starting from now onwards, and roadblocks will be conducted. We are working hand in hand with the police, farmers, the community, and forums.” Mokone said they would also be working with law-enforcement authorities to monitor the movement of animals to curb the spread of foot-and-mouth disease to other parts of the province. The department urged farmers and livestock owners to abide by the movement restrictions in place in all the affected areas to prevent the further spread of the virus. According to Mokone, signs of the disease may include depressed animals, sores in the animals’ mouths causing reluctance to eat, and lameness. “Any suspected cases of the disease must be reported immediately to the local state veterinarian. Affected areas are under quarantine, and no movement of animals and animal products is allowed. We’re in an understanding that we must cooperate with each other here. We will not allow movement until we are satisfied. There might be those who, when they think nobody is watching, will try to manoeuvre and sell animal products to each other, but we will be watching and beef up our team,” said Mokone. Farmers around Limpopo expressed their concerns about the increased livestock theft in their villages and farms, saying that the problem would never be solved as many police members were also involved in these criminal operations. One of the local farmers who attended the event, Mr Emmanuel Mudau of Mathuba Genetics, said they were afraid to get too deeply involved or report corrupt police officers, fearing that something bad might happen to them or their families. “We as farmers need to upgrade our security. We are losing all our goats and cattle. People are no longer stealing because they want to eat. Stock theft has now become a business - people don’t steal only one cow,” he said. Mudau also appealed to the government to assist them in vaccinating their livestock. Kaizer Nengovhela started writing stories for Limpopo Mirror in 2000. Prior to that he had a five year stint at Phala-Phala FM as sports presenter. In 2005 Kaizer received an award from the province's premier as Best Sports Presenter.

The latest incident occurred on Thursday in Hurdle Mills, when a resident called to report a skunk that was “interacting aggressively with livestock.” Animal Control removed the skunk, which later tested positive for rabies. Thursday’s incident is the fifth positive rabies test of the year in Orange County, surpassing the total from 2022. The frequency can be cyclical, but in recent years rabies has been far less prevalent locally than in years past: in 1997, for instance, Orange County reported 106 positive tests. Rabies is often found in skunks, but bats are the most common host species locally. While no pets were exposed to rabies in this case, animal officials are reminding everyone to make sure your pets are updated on their rabies vaccine. DID YOU KNOW? (courtesy of Orange County Animal Services) - Rabies virus can be transmitted through secondary saliva exposure when handling an animal, so do not touch your pet without gloves if it has had any possible exposure to rabies. - It is a law in North Carolina that dogs, cats and ferrets older than four months must have a current and valid rabies vaccination at all times. - If a rabies suspect animal is alive, do not attempt to capture the animal. Keep visual contact with the animal until an Animal Control Officer arrives. - If you discover a bat inside your house, be sure not to release it, but do remove yourself and any animals from the area. - Always call Orange County Animal Control immediately if you find a bat in your even if there is no evidence of a bite.

""Based on a ministerial-level meeting, the BNPB will soon form an integrated task force for emergency handling of rabies in NTT at the request of the governor of NTT,"" he said at a press conference at his ministry's office here. He informed that as of November 15, 2023, the NTT Health Office has reported 1,823 cases of bites from animals that transmit rabies to the Health Ministry. The cases were recorded in the South Timor Tengah and North Timor Tengah districts and caused 11 deaths. The ministerial-level meeting also emphasized that BNPB must immediately determine the status of disaster management as a basis for handling the rabies outbreak and emergency in NTT province. Effendy said that the agency will utilize ready-to-use funds to support the task force's operations, including increasing the number of vaccines and equipment needed for conducting rabies vaccinations. ""We are focusing on the emergency handling to be taken over by the BNPB, including the coordination with the central (government); it will include the Agriculture Ministry, the Health Ministry, and the required operational funds,"" he added. He said that regional governments and the provincial government had sought the allocation of operational funds to regions. However, the central government determined that regional governments were not ready for that yet. ""We have asked the regional governments to collect data on animals that have the potential to carry rabies, especially dogs. Thus, I have asked for a data collection of dogs in NTT,"" the minister informed.

(WDBJ/PDHD Release) - The Pittsylvania-Danville Health District (PDHD) is issuing a notice about a skunk testing positive for rabies in the Burnham Woods Community. The Pittsylvania-Danville Health District asks anyone who may have come into contact with the skunk to call the health district at 434-433-3545. Rabies, according to the health district, “is a deadly disease caused by a virus that attacks the nervous system. Rabies can be prevented in cats, dogs, ferrets and some livestock with a rabies vaccination. Rabies kills almost any mammal or human that gets sick from it. The rabies virus is mainly in the saliva and brain tissue of rabid animals. It can be transmitted through a bite or by getting saliva or brain tissue in a wound or in the eye or mouth.” To protect pets and their owners from rabies, Virginia law requires that “all dogs and cats four months of age and older be vaccinated for rabies by a licensed veterinarian, and that vaccinations be kept current.” The Pittsylvania-Danville Health District is reminding the public to avoid contact with bats, feral cats, stray dogs and wild animals, particularly in the area where the rabid skunk was found. Additional Steps to Protect Against Rabies Exposure: - Do not feed stray animals. Avoid wild animals, especially raccoons, bats, foxes and skunks. Feed your pets indoors and do not let them wander. - Make sure your pets are vaccinated against rabies and their shots are up to date. By law, all dogs, cats and ferrets must be vaccinated against rabies. - Teach children to avoid contact with wild animals and pets they are not familiar with. - Do not handle sick, injured or dead animals. - Keep wild animals out of s by capping chimneys with screens and blocking openings in attics, cellars and porches. Ensure trash cans have tight fitting lids. - If you observe any stray animals in the area, contact the Danville Animal Control for assistance at 434-799-5111. Please do not try to trap or handle stray and wild animals. - If you are bitten by a wild or stray animal, do not panic. Wash the wound(s) thoroughly with warm soapy water and contact animal control, your doctor or the Pittsylvania-Danville Health District for further recommendations.

code399,https://www.miragenews.com/marmoset-rabies-virus-variants-discovered-in-1125373/,Marmoset Rabies Virus Variants Discovered in Bats,"Rabies virus variants closely related to variants present in White-tufted marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) have been detected in bats in Ceará state, Northeast Brazil. Rabies is a deadly disease for humans. Its emergence in distinct wildlife species is a potential source of human infection and hence a public health concern. Marmosets are common in forests and conservation units throughout Brazil. In or near urban areas, they are often captured as pets and later abandoned. They have been linked to cases of human rabies. The study was supported by FAPESP and led by researchers at the Federal University of São Paulo's Medical School (EPM-UNIFESP). An article about it is published in the Journal of Medical Virology. Besides the similarity between the variants found in marmosets and the bats analyzed by the researchers, they were struck by the presence of the virus in fruit- and insect-eating bat species. Bats that feed on blood are considered more frequent hosts and important transmitters of rabies. ""Seven marmosets have recently tested positive for rabies. Rabies is endemic in Ceará, where people have been attacked by marmosets and died from rabies. One such death occurred in May,"" said Larissa Leão Ferrer de Sousa, a PhD candidate at EPM-UNIFESP and a veterinarian at the Ceará Central Public Health Laboratory (LACEN-CE) in Fortaleza. This death resulted from an attack on a 36-year-old farm worker in February near a town called Cariús. The man went to a health clinic in April, when symptoms started to appear but died shortly afterwards. Infection by rabies virus causes progressive encephalitis, a rapid inflammation of the brain that leads to death in almost 100% of cases. ""The marmoset fell into his backyard. It was semi-paralyzed, which is one of the symptoms of rabies. The man tried to help it, and it bit him. Animals with rabies aren't always aggressive and don't necessarily foam at the mouth, the symptom most people associate with rabies. Sometimes there are no apparent symptoms at all,"" she said. People should never touch bats or other wild animals, Sousa warned. Anyone who finds a dead wild animal should alert the local animal health surveillance agency, which will collect the remains for analysis. If they do have direct contact with the animal, they must immediately go to the nearest health clinic to be vaccinated against rabies and/or be given anti-rabies serum. ""Rabies incubates for 45 days on average, so it's extremely important for anyone who's infected to get post-exposure prophylaxis [serum and vaccine] immediately. When symptoms appear, it's normally too late, and the patient will die,"" said Ricardo Durães-Carvalho, a researcher at EPM-UNIFESP supported by FAPESP and principal investigator for the study. Genetic sequencing The researchers analyzed 144 brain tissue samples from 15 bat species. The animals arrived at LACEN-CE between January and July 2022 as part of the national epidemiological surveillance program, which requires health workers to collect mammals found dead or with symptoms of rabies in Ceará. RNA extracted from the samples was sequenced, and the genetic sequences for rabies virus were compared with sequences deposited in public databases. The researchers used computer-assisted tools to trace the evolutionary history of the viruses they found. The first set of sequences was compatible with rabies virus variants found in 2010 in Tadarida brasiliensis and Nyctinomops laticaudatus, insectivorous bat species from Southeast Brazil. However, another group of variants first found in bats (two insectivorous and one frugivorous species) were very close in evolutionary terms to the virus detected in marmosets from the Northeast. ""Our results allowed us to infer that the different rabies virus variants that were closely related in evolutionary terms were originally from the same animal, revealing complex spillover dynamics and multiple viral transmission between hosts,"" Durães-Carvalho said. Since vaccination of domestic animals became widespread, wild animals have been the main source of human rabies in the Americas. The first death from rabies linked to a marmoset was reported in 1991, also in Ceará. Since then, 14 other deaths in the same state have been attributed to transmission by these primates. Bats and marmosets may be key links in the rabies transmission chain in Brazil, but both play important ecological roles and are suffering from habitat loss due to urban and agricultural expansion. Bats in particular are important to ecosystem equilibrium, and fundamental to seed dispersal, pollination and pest control. ""It's best to respect these animals and leave them alone to live in the wild,"" Sousa said. The study was also supported by FAPESP via five other projects (20/08943-5, 19/14526‐0, 22/09684‐9, 22/08748‐3 and 21/05661‐1).

(WTOC) - A bat tested positive for rabies in Savannah’s midtown area Tuesday. According to Chatham County Health Department’s Environmental Health office, a person found the bat in a parking lot on 31st Street near Abercorn Street. When they attempted to nudge the bat away from cars, the person was bitten. The person has received follow-up medical care, and there were no other known exposures. The Chatham County Health Department’s Environmental Health office says this incident is a reminder that several species of wild animals in our area can carry rabies, including raccoons, foxes, and bats. Rabies is a potentially deadly virus that is primarily spread by infected animals. Following these tips can protect you and your family from rabies: - Avoid contact with animals you don’t know. - Make sure your pets receive the proper immunizations. Dogs and cats should get rabies vaccines after 12 weeks of age, followed by a booster shot within one year and vaccination every 1-3 years depending on veterinary recommendation and vaccine used. - Do not handle, feed, or unintentionally attract wild animals with open garbage cans or by leaving pet food out at night. - Never adopt wild animals or bring them into your . Do not try to nurse sick animals to health. Call animal control or a properly licensed animal rescue agency for assistance. - Teach children to never handle unfamiliar animals, wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly. “Love your own, leave other animals alone” is a good principle for children to learn. Symptoms of rabies in animals include a change in behavior, biting, aggression, showing no fear of natural enemies (such as humans), foaming at the mouth, and paralysis. If an animal ever bites you, seek medical care immediately and contact Chatham County Animal Services at 912-652-6575 and the Chatham County Environmental Health office at 912-356-2160.
